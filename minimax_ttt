'''using the minimax algo. find the best possible move to make.
Minimax finds the best possible moves by applying a set of rules.
A win = 1, tie = 0, loss = -1 (for us). Assuming that each player chooses the best move
(we choose 1 if possible, opponent chooses -1). Starting at the top of a 'game tree',
generate the possible moves we can make. If It reaches a terminal state, stop. Otherwise keep searching in depth.
We find max.
